# EducationBuff
This is a demonstration mod to show the possibilities of modding Software Inc. with the Harmony Patch Library. Specifically, this mod allows you to adjust how long you need to send your employee to school to (mostly) max out a skill of your choosing.

## Requirements
1. Harmony Patch Library v1.2.0.1 (included)
2. Software Inc. Alpha 10 (tested on A10.10)

## How to install
1. Download the latest release (in https://github.com/Designer225/EducationBuff/releases) of this mod. Extract the contents of the mod to the DLLMods folder inside your Software Inc. directory.
2. Start up your game. If you haven't already bound your key to opening console, do so by going to Settings -> Keys, and then bind "Open Console" to a key of your choosing. (You might not have to do this, but do it just in case.)
3. Activate the in-game console and type `RELOAD_DLL_MOD EducationBuff2`
4. Activate the mod in the Mod section of settings.
5. Enjoy!
